IF-C01COMG Clone board THT Full size

This is a full sized version of the IF-C01COMG board for JVC pro monitors (TM-Hxx50CG) and some others...

It's basically the THT base board I made some years ago with SCART or BNC input and some audio mixing
stuff.

Credit goes to James Vanderloeff for the dual input idea.

You can upload the zip file from the plot directory directly to manufacturers that don't do kicad files directly.

You're welcome to clone, sell, re-design and whatever, see LICENSE.

IF-C01COMG Clone board THT Full size

This is a full sized version of the IF-C01COMG board for JVC pro monitors (TM-Hxx50CG) and some others...

It's basically the THT base board I made some years ago with SCART or BNC input and some audio mixing
stuff.

It is still an unverified design, but should work, as the THT stuff has been tested as working.
